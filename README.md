## Installation
It is still in a work in progress, sadly. It is not recommended to install and it is not supposed to work to install still.

##### go
```bash
# coming
```
##### bash
```bash
# coming
```


## Getting Started
### config.toml
We love building those, but now, we shouldn't

```bash
dina update
```
The best way to use `dina` is by this.
It will create the file config.toml and organize it using the folder structure. If flags like `--flatpaks` are passed, it will be added too, use --help to filter and make it more tailored to your likes.

A basic config.toml file is as this:

```toml

[[stow]]
name = "yazi"
scripts = [ ]
dependencies = [ ]

[[stow]]
name = "hypr"
dependencies = [ "blight", "fish" ]

[[stow]]
name = "kitty"
scripts = [ "fonts.sh" ]

flatpak = [ "com.spotify.Client", "org.mozilla.firefox" ]
```

The above example would use the next folder structure:
```md
# .dotfiles
config/
    hypr/
        hyprland.conf
        .scripts/
            fish.sh
        .dependencies # text file
	kitty/
		.scripts/
			fonts.sh
		kitty.conf
	yazi/
		yazi.toml
config.toml
```
